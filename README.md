# Cloze Sequence

Simple Anki template for memorization of lists, enumerations and procedures. Very similar to the builtin cloze functionality, with the difference being that:

- Only one card is created per cloze and thus all items are reviewed in the same session.
- Cloze items are revealed (and hidden) by directly clicking on them.
- There is no order of review. Can be sequential or totally random.

## FAQ

### Why is @@@ used as a delimiter?

Because it is the delimiter that (I found) has the least clashes and chances of being used for other purposes.

### Why a template and not a plugin?

Because even though this would make a few things easier (such as a button for adding a cloze item), plugins do frequently break when Anki is updated. Unfortunately I can't keep it updated for free with the limited time I have.

### Does it work on mobile?

Yes.

## Contributing

I don't think there's much to contribute code wise, but it's welcome. Keep in mind the following before doing so.

### Submitting an issue

Issue submissions are for bug reports, questions and suggestions.

### Feature requests

Feature requests might be taken into consideration if they don't stray out of the template's scope.
